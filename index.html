                      <span id="my-jimdel9"><strong>Oyedepo</strong>Oyedepo became "born again" at the age of 15 in 1969,
                        <br><br>through the influence of his teacher Betty Lasher (18 June 1930 – 26 August 2022), 
                        who took an interest in him during his high school days. According to him,
                        <br><br> he received a mandate from God through an 18-hour vision in May 1981,
                         to liberate the world from all oppressions of the devil through the preaching of the word of faith.,
                         <br><br> This is the inaugural vision that led to the founding of the Living Faith Church World Wide (LFCWW), 
                         first called Liberation Faith Hour Ministries, in 1981.


                              <p> years later, on 17 September 1983, Pastor Enoch Adeboye, General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God,
                                <br><br>ordained David and his wife, Florence Abiola Akano (known as Faith Abiola Oyedepo to become pastors and officially commissioned the new church. 
                                Five years later,<br><br> Oyedepo was ordained as Bishop by his life mentor, the late Archbishop Benson Idahosa.</p>


                                <p>iving Faith Church (AKA Winners Chapel International) started in Kaduna but moved to Lagos,<br><br> the former capital of Nigeria in July 1989, 
                                    to start a new branch of the church after <br><br>Oyedepo claimed to have received instructions from God to reach out to the people of Lagos.

                                    According to Forbes, Oyedepo is the wealthiest preacher in the world with a net worth of over US$150 million.
                                     <br><br>The church owns four private jets and several buildings, including in London and the US. 
                                     <br><br>Oyedepo is an author and publisher who has written over 70 titles apart from periodicals.<br><br>
                                      He is the chairman or publisher of Dominion Publishing House (DPH), <br><br>a publishing arm of the ministry. 
                                      DPH has over 4 million prints in circulation to date. 
                                      <br><br>Through Oyedepo; Covenant University, Faith Academy,
                                       <br><br>and Kingdom Heritage Model Schools have been established to equip the youth for global impact.
                                      <br</br>The construction of a third university named Crown University is already underway, 
                                     <br><br>located in Calabar, Cross River, Nigeria.
                                    
                                    In 1998, Oyedepo claimed he was instructed by God to build a new base for the commission to accommodate the increasing number of worshippers. 
                                    <br><br>This resulted in Oyedepo's church's acquisition of the initial 530-acre (2.1 km2) facility,<Br><br> known as Canaanland, which serves as the headquarters. 
                                    It is the home of the 50,000-seat capacity auditorium, the 'Faith Tabernacle'. <br><br>This was a feat also recorded by the Guinness Book of Records.
                                    
                                    Construction was completed within 12 months. Reports also claimed that this building was built debt-free.
                                     <br><br>This 50,000-seat edifice was dedicated on 18 September 1999, under the administration of former President Olusegun Obasanjo.
                                    
                                    Canaanland is in Ota, Ogun state, and is the 5,000-acre (20 km2) estate and campus, <br><br>that houses The 50,000-seat auditorium,
